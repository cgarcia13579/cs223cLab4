Then, implement the "median" and "mode" functions so that they actually work correctly. These functions should take variable arguments, as documented in the C Programming wikibook. In the template file, both functions are stubs that always return 0, which is obviously not correct.

Again, there is a main() function that tests the correctness of your functions. This time, in addition to refactoring the two functions, you are also required to add at least two tests for each of the functions (so add at least 4 tests to main()).
